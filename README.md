# streamlit-photonic-circuits
This repository provides a framework for building photonics circuits with modular components (Sources, Point Couplers, Waveguides, ...) and studying their linear spectral properties at different points. A streamlit dashboard with interactive graphs is added to provide a user-friendly interface to the circuit properties.
